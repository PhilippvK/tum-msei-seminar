## PREREQUISITES:
Optional (if not done, please use 'defaultfont' option):
 Install the TUM LaTeX template for letters, because that delivers the TUM New Helvetica font that you need for that.
 Download at http://portal.mytum.de/corporatedesign/download/LaTeX_Vorlagen/index_html

## INSTALLATION:
 Copy these files somewhere in your local texmf path, e.g. to ~/texmf/tex/latex/tum/beamer. Then run texhash in the
 root directory, e.g.:

 cd ~/texmf
 texhash .

## USAGE
See example.tex

### Modes
The template supports two beamer modes (provided by the options with the same names):
 * '''beamer''': colored theme including navigation elements for on-screen presentation.
 * '''handout/article/trans''': Logo and separation lines are black, no navigation elements.
Further, there are various options:
 * `nonci`: better use of space, but not CI compliant 
 * `headfootlines`: separator lines for header and footer
 * `conference`: logos only on title page
 * `rcslogo`: replace TUM logo with RCS logo
 * `titleimage`: the first slide with the title has a blue background with waving TUM flags
 * `color=blue`: not fully supported...inverse color scheme
 * `tumfont`: do use TUM font, instead of LaTeX beamer's standard one

Suggested: nonci
